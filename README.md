- ðŸ“« How to reach me on Discord Janksmith#5163

Current Projects:
-Love and Incredible Violence a TTRPG designed to replicate the Saturday Morning Cartoon Magical Girl vibes
-Stolen Victory a bobber-style dungeon crawler where the aim is never to become stronger, just smarter
ASCII Transmission a life-sim where the entier game is rendered with the draw_text function on GameMaker as a challenge (and a way to avoid having to make graphical assets for all the items)
